# **Speech Recognition**

The provided code demonstrates how to use the speech_recognition library to convert speech to text using the Google Web Speech API. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import the speech_recognition module as sr.

Define a function named speech_to_text() to perform the speech recognition process.

Inside the speech_to_text() function:

a. Initialize a Recognizer instance called recognizer. This instance is used to recognize speech.

b. Use a context manager (with statement) and a Microphone instance from the sr module to capture audio from the microphone. The adjust_for_ambient_noise() method is used to adapt to the ambient noise level before recording.

c. Use the listen() method of the recognizer instance to record audio from the microphone. The recorded audio is stored in the audio variable.

d. Wrap the speech recognition process in a try block to handle exceptions.

e. Inside the try block:

Use the recognize_google() method of the recognizer instance to recognize the speech in the recorded audio. This method uses the Google Web Speech API to convert speech to text.

Print the recognized text to the console.

f. Use except blocks to handle possible exceptions. If the UnknownValueError exception is raised, it means that the speech recognition could not understand the audio. If the RequestError exception is raised, it indicates an error occurred while making a request to the Google Web Speech API.

In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, the speech_to_text() function is called when the script is executed.

When you run this code, it will listen to your speech through the microphone and attempt to convert it to text using the Google Web Speech API. The recognized text will be printed to the console. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed and that your microphone is properly configured.
