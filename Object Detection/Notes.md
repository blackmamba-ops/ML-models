# **Object Detection**


This code is an example of real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model and OpenCV. Let's go through the code step by step:

**Import Libraries:**

cv2: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
torch: PyTorch library for deep learning.
torch.hub: A utility in PyTorch for loading pre-trained models from GitHub repositories.

**Load YOLOv5 Model:**

The line model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s') loads the YOLOv5 small model (yolov5s) from the ultralytics/yolov5 GitHub repository. This model is pre-trained for object detection.

**Create VideoCapture Object:**

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) initializes a VideoCapture object to capture frames from the webcam (camera index 0).

**Set Sharing Strategy for DataLoader:**

torch.multiprocessing.set_sharing_strategy('file_system') sets the sharing strategy for PyTorch's DataLoader to use the file system. This can help with compatibility when using multiprocessing in certain environments.

**Main Loop for Object Detection:**

The code enters a loop that continuously captures frames from the webcam and performs object detection on them.

**Capture Frame from Webcam:**

ret, frame = cap.read() reads a frame from the webcam. ret is a boolean indicating whether the frame was successfully read.

**Perform Object Detection:**

results = model(frame) performs object detection on the captured frame using the pre-loaded YOLOv5 model. The results contain information about detected objects.

**Retrieve and Draw Detections:**

The detections are retrieved from results.pred[0].
For each detection, the label, confidence score, and bounding box coordinates are extracted.
If the confidence score is above a certain threshold (0.3 in this case), a rectangle is drawn around the detected object using cv2.rectangle(), and the label with confidence is displayed near the rectangle using cv2.putText().

**Display the Frame with Detections:**

cv2.imshow('Object Detection', frame) displays the frame with drawn bounding boxes and labels.

**Quit the Loop:**

The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key.
Pressing 'q' breaks the loop, and the captured video is released and OpenCV windows are closed using cap.release() and cv2.destroyAllWindows().
In summary, this code captures frames from the webcam, performs real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model, and displays the frames with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects. The user can press the 'q' key to quit the application.
