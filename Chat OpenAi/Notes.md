# **ChatBot**

This code demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create a simple chatbot using the GPT-3.5 model (engine: text-davinci-003). The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user, generating responses based on the user's input. Here's how the code works:

**Importing the openai Library:**

The code begins by importing the openai library, which provides access to OpenAI's APIs.

**Main Function:**

The main() function is the heart of the chatbot and handles the interaction between the user and the chatbot.

**Setting API Key:**

Inside the main() function, the OpenAI API key is set using the line:

arduino
Copy code
openai.api_key = "YOUR OPEN AI API KEY"
Replace "YOUR OPEN AI API KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key, which you obtain from the OpenAI platform.

**Interactive Loop:**

The code enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly interacts with the user. In each iteration, it does the following:

Takes user input using input("You: ").
Sends the user input to the GPT-3.5 model using the openai.Completion.create() function. It provides the engine, prompt, and max_tokens arguments:
engine: Specifies which GPT-3 engine to use. In this case, "text-davinci-003" is used.
prompt: The user input that serves as the starting point for generating a response.
max_tokens: Controls the length of the generated response.
Prints the generated response from the model using response.choices[0].text.strip().

**Execution:**

The main() function is called when __name__ is "__main__", which initiates the chatbot interaction loop.

In summary, this code demonstrates a simple chatbot using the GPT-3.5 model through the OpenAI API. The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user by taking their input, sending it to the model, and receiving and displaying the generated response. The loop continues indefinitely, allowing for interactive conversations with the chatbot.
