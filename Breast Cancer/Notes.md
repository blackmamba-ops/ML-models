# **Breast Cancer(KNN Classifier)**

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for breast cancer classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. Here's how the code works and an explanation of the model and its use:

**Import Libraries:**

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset, KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors for creating the KNN classifier, and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics for evaluating the model's accuracy.

**Load and Prepare Data:**

The Breast Cancer dataset is loaded from a CSV file named 'Breast_Cancer.csv'. The features are stored in the DataFrame X, and the target labels (cancer status: malignant or benign) are stored in the Series y. The categorical features are one-hot encoded using pd.get_dummies() to convert them into a suitable format for the KNN algorithm.

**Train-Validation-Test Split:**

The data is split into training, validation, and test sets using train_test_split(). The split is 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test. The random state is set for reproducibility.

**KNN Classifier Training:**

A KNN classifier with n_neighbors=3 is created and trained on the training data using the fit() method.

**Validation and Test Set Evaluation:**

The model's predictions are generated on both the validation set (X_val) and the test set (X_test). The accuracy of the model is calculated using accuracy_score() by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

**Display Predictions:**

The model's predictions on the test set are stored in a DataFrame named predictions_df. This DataFrame contains the predicted labels for each instance in the test set. The predictions are displayed using pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None) to prevent truncation, ensuring that all predictions are visible.

**Explanation of the KNN Model:**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple classification algorithm. It works by finding the k training samples that are closest to a given test sample and classifying the test sample based on the majority class among its k neighbors.

**The KNN algorithm involves the following steps:**

Calculate the distance between the test instance and all training instances using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
Select the k nearest neighbors with the shortest distances.
Assign the class label that is most common among the k neighbors to the test instance.
KNN is a non-parametric and instance-based algorithm, meaning it doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It's often used for simple classification tasks and can perform well when there's sufficient data and feature scaling.

In this code, the KNN classifier is trained on the one-hot encoded breast cancer dataset and evaluated on both the validation and test sets. The accuracy of the model on the validation and test sets is printed, and the predictions on the test set are displayed in a DataFrame.

Remember that while KNN is straightforward, it may not be the best choice for all datasets. Experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters is important to find the best model for a given task.

This Model can predicts wheather the patient survive or not.
