
Achieving perfect accuracy in predicting continuous values like sales is quite challenging, and even with hyperparameter tuning, there might be limitations to how accurate the model can get. Here are a few things you could consider to further improve the accuracy:

**Feature Engineering:** Ensure you have included all relevant features in your dataset. You might want to explore if there are any other features that could provide valuable information for predicting sales.

**Data Quality:** Make sure your data is clean and free from errors. Erroneous or missing data can significantly affect the model's accuracy.

**Feature Scaling:** Scaling numerical features can sometimes improve the performance of decision tree-based models. You can use techniques like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to scale your features.

**Ensemble Methods:** Consider using ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting. These methods combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.

**Advanced Models:** If your data is very complex, you might explore using more advanced regression models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or neural networks. These models can capture more complex relationships in the data.

**Data Amount:** A larger dataset might improve the model's generalization ability.

**Domain Knowledge:** Consider seeking domain-specific expertise to understand if there are any insights or variables that are critical for predicting sales.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Continue refining your hyperparameter tuning. The code I provided was a basic example, and you might need to explore a wider range of hyperparameters.

Remember that predictive accuracy also depends on the inherent variability and unpredictability of sales data. While striving for the best possible model is important, it's also important to understand the limitations of the data and the model itself.
