 An example of how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for gene expression data analysis using Python.
 Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and PCA
from sklearn.decomposition. These libraries will be used for data manipulation, visualization, and PCA.

Synthetic Gene Expression Data: A synthetic gene expression dataset is generated using np.random.rand(). The dataset
has dimensions of num_samples (rows) and num_genes (features).

Preprocessing: Standardization: The gene expression data is standardized using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
 This step is crucial for PCA, as it ensures that features with different scales do not dominate the analysis.

Perform PCA: The PCA is performed using PCA from sklearn.decomposition. In this case, the number of components is set
to 2 using n_components=2.

Create DataFrame for Visualization: The PCA results are stored in a DataFrame called pca_df, which has columns 'PC1'
and 'PC2' representing the first and second principal components, respectively.

Plot the Results: The code uses matplotlib.pyplot to create a scatter plot of the PCA results. Each point in the plot
represents a sample, with the x-axis representing the first principal component (PC1) and the y-axis representing the
second principal component (PC2).

Show the Plot: Finally, the plot is displayed using plt.show().

This code demonstrates how to perform PCA on synthetic gene expression data and visualize the results. You can replace
the synthetic gene expression data with your own dataset to analyze the principal components and gain insights into the
underlying structure of the data.
