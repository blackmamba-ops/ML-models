The given codes defines and trains a deep learning model for sentiment analysis using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network,
which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN).

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs are a class of artificial neural
networks designed to process sequences of data, where each data point depends on the previous ones. LSTM is a
specialized variant of RNNs, specifically designed to address some of the limitations of traditional RNNs when dealing
with long-term dependencies.
