# **Frozen Lake Problem**
This code implements the Q-learning algorithm to solve the "Frozen Lake" problem, a common example used to demonstrate reinforcement learning concepts. In this problem, an agent navigates a gridworld to reach a goal while avoiding holes (H) that lead to failure.

Here's how the code works:

**Constants and Initialization:**

The code starts by setting constants such as the number of rows and columns in the gridworld, the possible actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), learning parameters (ALPHA, GAMMA, EPSILON), and the number of episodes to run (EPISODES).

It also initializes a Q-table with zeros to store Q-values for each state-action pair. The Q-table will be updated during training to approximate the optimal policy.

**Environment Description:**

The Frozen Lake environment is described as a 4x4 grid represented by a 2D list (frozen_lake). The grid contains states marked as "S" (start), "F" (frozen), "H" (hole), and "G" (goal). The goal is to navigate from the start state to the goal state while avoiding holes.

**Q-Table Updates:**

get_next_state(state, action): This function calculates the next state given the current state and an action.

choose_action(state): This function chooses an action for the agent based on exploration (random action with probability EPSILON) and exploitation (choosing the action with the highest Q-value for the current state).

update_q_table(state, action, next_state, reward): This function updates the Q-table using the Q-learning formula. It calculates the predicted Q-value for the current state-action pair, the target Q-value using the Bellman equation, and then updates the Q-value using the learning rate ALPHA.

**Visualization:**

visualize_path(path): This function visualizes the agent's path on the gridworld. It uses matplotlib to draw the grid and arrows to represent the agent's movement.
**Training:**

train(): This function implements the Q-learning training loop. It runs for the specified number of episodes. In each episode, the agent starts at the initial state and takes actions to navigate the gridworld until reaching the goal state. The Q-table is updated based on the rewards obtained during the episode.
**Main Function:**

main(): This function initiates the training process and waits for user input to exit. After training, it displays a message indicating completion and prompts the user to exit or continue.
**Execution:**

The code is executed when __name__ is "__main__". It calls the main() function to start the training process and visualize the agent's path for every 100 episodes.

In summary, this code demonstrates the Q-learning algorithm applied to the Frozen Lake problem, where the agent learns to navigate the gridworld to reach the goal state while avoiding holes. The Q-learning updates the Q-values based on rewards and the agent's interactions with the environment, gradually improving the agent's decision-making over time.
