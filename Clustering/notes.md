# **Clustering algorithms**

Clustering algorithms can be broadly categorized into four main types based on how they group data points:

**Centroid-based Clustering:**

Algorithms in this category aim to group data points around centroids (cluster centers).
K-Means is a classic example of a centroid-based clustering algorithm.
It initializes K centroids and assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, iteratively updating centroids to minimize distances.

**Density-based Clustering:**

Density-based algorithms focus on identifying areas of high data point density and separating them from low-density regions.
DBSCAN and OPTICS are popular density-based clustering algorithms.
They don't rely on predefined cluster shapes and can identify arbitrary cluster shapes.

**Distribution-based Clustering:**

Distribution-based algorithms model clusters as statistical distributions, often Gaussian distributions.
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is a widely used distribution-based clustering algorithm.
It assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and estimates their parameters.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**

Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or splitting clusters.
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering starts with individual data points as clusters and iteratively merges them.
Divisive Hierarchical Clustering starts with a single cluster and recursively splits it into smaller clusters.
These categories are not mutually exclusive, and some algorithms can exhibit characteristics of multiple categories. It's important to choose a clustering algorithm based on the nature of your data and the problem you're trying to solve. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, so understanding their principles can help you make an informed choice for your specific scenario.
