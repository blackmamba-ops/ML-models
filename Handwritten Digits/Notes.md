# **Handwritten Digits(GAN)**


**Generator Model:**
The generator model takes random noise from a latent space as input. It consists of a series of fully connected (dense) layers with increasing complexity. The purpose of the generator is to learn how to transform the random noise into data that resembles the target dataset. It generates images that gradually become more similar to the real data distribution.

**Discriminator Model:**
The discriminator model is responsible for distinguishing between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator. It takes images as input and consists of a series of layers that progressively reduce the complexity. The discriminator's goal is to learn to differentiate between real and fake images.

**GAN Model:**
The GAN model combines the generator and discriminator. During training, the generator creates fake images from random noise, and the discriminator evaluates both real and fake images. The discriminator's feedback is used to train the generator to produce more convincing images that can deceive the discriminator. The goal is for the generator to produce images that are indistinguishable from real images.

**Training Loop:**
The training loop iterates over a specified number of epochs. For each epoch, it iterates through the dataset in batches. During each iteration, the GAN goes through two main steps:

**Discriminator Training:**
The discriminator evaluates both real and generated images. It is trained to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels (1 for real images, 0 for fake images). Noise is added to the labels to prevent the discriminator from becoming too confident.

**Generator Training:**
The generator takes random noise as input and generates fake images. The generator's goal is to create images that the discriminator misclassifies as real. The GAN's loss for the generator is computed based on the discriminator's performance, encouraging the generator to improve over time.

After each epoch, generated images are plotted to visualize the progress of the generator.

G**enerate and Plot Images:**
This function generates a specified number of images using the generator model. It takes random noise from the latent space and generates images that are displayed in a grid for visualization. Over epochs, the quality of generated images is expected to improve as the generator learns to produce more realistic samples.

Overall, the GAN architecture involves a continuous interplay between the generator and discriminator. As the generator improves its ability to create realistic images, the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between real and fake images. This adversarial process drives the model towards producing increasingly convincing and high-quality generated data.
