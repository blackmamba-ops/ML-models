Autoencoders: A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, often used for feature learning and data compression.

code demonstrates how to implement an autoencoder for denoising images using the Keras library. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries, including numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, mnist from keras.datasets, Model,
 Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and UpSampling2D from keras.layers.

Load and Preprocess MNIST Dataset: Define a function load_dataset() that loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset. The
 images are normalized and reshaped to have a shape of (28, 28, 1).

Add Noise to Images: Define a function add_noise() that adds random noise to the images. The noise level is controlled
by the noise_factor.

Load and Prepare Data: Load the MNIST dataset using the load_dataset() function and then add noise to the images using
the add_noise() function.

Build Autoencoder Model: Define the architecture of the autoencoder model. The model includes convolutional layers for
 encoding and decoding the images. The encoded images are then decoded using upsampling layers.

Compile Model: Compile the autoencoder model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

Train Autoencoder: Train the autoencoder model using the noisy images as input and the original clean images as targets.
 The training is performed for a specified number of epochs.

Display Original and Denoised Images: After training, use the trained autoencoder to denoise the noisy test images.
 Display a comparison of the original noisy images and the denoised images side by side using matplotlib.

Show Plot: Display the matplotlib plot showing the original noisy images and their denoised counterparts.

The autoencoder is trained to learn a compressed representation of the input noisy images and then decode them to produce
 denoised versions. The goal is to reduce the noise while preserving the essential features of the original images.
