# **Image Denoising**                                               

**Autoencoders:** A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, often used for feature learning and data compression.

The provided code demonstrates the creation and training of a Convolutional Autoencoder using the Keras library to denoise images from the MNIST dataset. Here's an explanation of the key steps and concepts involved:

**Loading and Preprocessing Data:**

The MNIST dataset is loaded, containing grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Images are normalized to a range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Images are reshaped to have a shape of (batch_size, 28, 28, 1) to match the input shape of the model.

**Adding Noise to Images:**

A noise factor is introduced to create noisy versions of the original images.
Gaussian noise is added to the images with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Noisy images are clipped to ensure pixel values remain in the valid [0, 1] range.

**Autoencoder Architecture:**

The autoencoder consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder.
The encoder part compresses the input images into a lower-dimensional representation.
The decoder part reconstructs the denoised images from the compressed representation.
Convolutional layers are used for feature extraction, and max-pooling layers are used for down-sampling.

**Model Compilation and Training:**

The autoencoder is compiled using the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function.
The noisy images are used as input, and the target is set as the original, clean images.
The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using batch training.

**Displaying Original and Denoised Images:**

After training, the autoencoder is used to denoise the noisy test images.
A visualization is created to compare original and denoised images side by side.
For each sample in the test set, both the original and denoised images are displayed.
The denoised images are obtained by passing the noisy images through the trained autoencoder.
In summary, a convolutional autoencoder is trained to remove noise from MNIST images. The encoder-decoder architecture learns to capture essential features of the images while eliminating the introduced noise, resulting in denoised images that closely resemble the original clean images. This technique is useful for noise reduction and dimensionality reduction in image data
